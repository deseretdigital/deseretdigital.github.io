Today I found a problem with using the popular Ubuntu PPA ppa:ondrej/php5
for installing PHP 5.4 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. The maintainer of the PPA updated
them from 5.4 to 5.5, which also requires Apache 2.4 and can cause a lot of
other side effects.

If you want to keep using PHP 5.4 on Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, you can use the new PPA
ppa:ondrej/php5-oldstable.
