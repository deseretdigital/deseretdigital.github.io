So we've decided to abandon our old WordPress blog for a GitHub pages powered Octopress setup.

Why the change? To be honest, it better fits our need. Everyone on our team gets setup with a GitHub account, and so they can automatically have permissions to modify this blog. I also do not believe we'll have very large volumes of posts, so a super fast way to update the blog isn't necessary. Also everyone knows git and markdown, and its also a neat way of hosting a blog. We're hoping this will be a much more successful way of running a tech blog for the company.
